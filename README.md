## Better BungeeOnlineTime Placeholders
### This plugin uses BungeeOnlineTimes database and lets you have more flexible placeholders for leaderboards.

Requires: https://github.com/R3fleXi0n/BungeeOnlineTime

By default BungeeOnlineTime has limited placeholders, with no leaderboard support. this plugin changes that. (a bit)

To use this plugin, put it in your plugin folder on your SERVER, change the config.yml values to the same database your BungeeOnlineTime plugin uses.
The table is hard coded to be BungeeOnlineTime - default generated by the BungeeOnlineTime plugin.

This plugin exists solely because nothing else worked or cost 20 quid with useless features.
I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS.
I RUN THIS ON 1.19.4 - PAPI version 2.11.6
anything else is untested...

I use VELOCITY proxy, with the bungee plugin in the 'snap' folder - so velocity can run the bungee plugin.

will this break? probably. will i maintain it? probably not.

!! Remember:

Velocity Proxy -> plugins/snap/BungeeOnlineTime.jar

Server -> plugins/betterbotplaceholders.jar

ALL THIS DOES IS TAKE INFO FROM THE DATABASE USED BY BungeeOnlineTime. IT DOENST RECORD PLAYTIME.

### Player-Specific Placeholders
| Placeholder | Example | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `%bot_player_totalseconds%` | "93600" | Your total seconds |
| `%bot_player_seconds%` | "30" | Your seconds component |
| `%bot_player_totalminutes%` | "1560" | Your total minutes |
| `%bot_player_minutes%` | "45" | Your minutes component |
| `%bot_player_totalhours%` | "26" | Your total hours |
| `%bot_player_hours%` | "2" | Your hours component |
| `%bot_player_totaldays%` | "1" | Your total days |
| `%bot_player_days%` | "1" | Your days component |
| `%bot_player_formatted%` | "1d 2h 30m" | Your formatted time |

### Formatting Rules
- Components show current unit only (e.g. `%bot_player_hours%` shows 0-23)
- Formatted versions auto-hide zero values (e.g. "2h 0m" becomes "2h")
- All placeholders return "0" or "N/A" for invalid data

Use your brain a bit, ive added support for each individual numerical component, be it totals or formatted. Mix and match stuff idk.
